## SaaS Programming

* SaaS is a way of delivering applications over the Internet - as a service.
* You don't need to install/maintain/manage the software
* All a user needs is an internet connection to gain access in SaaS
* Runs on SaaS providers' servers.
* Provider manages everything - access, security, availability, performance, etc

## SaaS Characteristics

* Multi-tenant Architecture
* Users can easily customise and personalize to their liking
* Better access - developed for multiple clients over a vast geographical spans so, access is ensured to be better
* "Harness the Consumer Web" - If you access to a web browser, and an internet connection, you can gain access to a SaaS app
* SaaS trends - developing SaaS integration platforms for building additional SaaS applications (Ex: Google Meet + Gmail, Slack + Zoom)

## Why use SaaS?

* Flexible - "Pay as you go" model
* Scalable - High vertical scalability (and scalability in general) - customers can access more/fewer services/features on-demand
* Automatic updates - SaaS provider automatically perform updates and maintenance.
* Accessibility and Persistence - SaaS apps are delivered over the Internet, so users can access from anywhere, anytime, as long as they have an internet connection

## Disadvantages of SaaS

* Security - multitenancy, and because data is stored in the cloud (and in-house deployment is always more secure)
* Latency issue - compared to local deployment, there may be greater latency as data and apps in cloud at variable distances. Therefore, this is not suitable for apps who demand response times in milliseconds.
* Total Dependency on Internet - Without an internet connection, you can't use this
* Switching between vendors is difficult - involves difficult slow task of transferring very large data files over the internet and then converting and importing them into another SaaS also

## Microservices vs Monolithic Architectures

### Monolithic Architecture

* Traditional way of building applications
* Built as a single and indivisible unit
* Comprises of a client-side UI, server side-application, and a database
* Follows intra-process communication

#### Strengths

* Simple development
* Simple to test - launch and start end-to-end testing
* Straightforward deployment
* Simple scalability...until a point - you only need to have new instance of the monolithic application, but as the application size grows, this becomes a problem
* Hard to maintain
* Hard to redeploy
* Issues with flexibility, and reliability

### Microservices Architecture

* Architectural Style - developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API
* Independently deployable (by automated deployment mechanisms)
* Bare minimum of centralized management
* Breaks down an application into a collection of smaller, independent units
* Each unit carries out every application process as a separate service
* All services have their own logic and the database as well
* Follows inter-process communication using protocols
* Considered to be an "Evolution of SoA", where the services are more fine-grained

#### Benefits

* Flexibility - different microservices can be developed in different technologies, newer tech can be adopted easily
* Reliability - one feature going down won't cause entire app to go down
* Development speed - fast as the volume of code is lesser. Easier to understand, and maintain, and update
* Easier to build complex applications - independent features can be broken down into independent components and deployed independently. independent components cna be further broken down into small independent tasks, which can be deployed independently as a microservice.
* Scalability - Each service can be scaled individually
* Continous deployment - in order to update one component, only that microservice has to be redeployed

focus is on business functionality reuse            focus is on the concept of Single Responsibility
Uses Enterprise Service Bus                         Simple messaging system
support multiple message protocols                  support lightweight protocols
multi-threaded (with overhead for I/O features)     single-threaded (usually using Event Loop features for non-locking I/O features)
