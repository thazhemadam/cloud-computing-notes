## Communication using Message Queues

### Monolithic Application

* Multiple components, tightly coupled, runs on a single process
* Components communicate using language-level function calls
* Intra-process communication - All components run within same process.

## Microservice Architecture

* Architectural style
* Variant of the SoA
* Runs on multiple process/services, usually across multiple servers
* Structures an application as a collection of services that are loosely coupled.
* Services interact using inter-process communication protocols
* "Inter-service communication is essential to consider when building micro-services".

## Interaction Styles

Two dimensions - 

First dimension - 
* One to one - one client request is processed by exactly one service - 1  producer, 1 consumer
* One to many - each processed message is going to be consumed by multiple consumers - 1 producer, multiple consumers 

Second Dimension - 
* Synchronous - (client blocks while it waits for response from service)
* Asynchronous - (client doesn't block)

```
                 One-to-One                         One-to-many
             _____________________________________________________________________
Synchronous  |   Request/response                 |   -                          |
Asynchronous |   Asynchronous Request/response    |   Publish/Subscribe          |
             |   One-way notifications            |   Publish/async Responses    |
             |____________________________________|______________________________|
```

## One-to-one Interaction

* One-way notification - Client sends request to a service, but no reply is expected by client/sent by service.
* Request/Response - Client makes request and waits for response to come in a timely fashion. Client may even block while waiting. Service replies with the results of the request processed. Client unblocks itself (if blocked) and continues processing. Tightly coupled.
* Asynchronous request/Response - Client sends request.  Client doesn't block while waiting because it could take a while to get a reply from the Service. Service replies with the results of the request processed.

## One-to-many interaction

* Publish/Subscribe - Client publishes a request. 0/more services consume the request.
* Publish/Async Responses - Client publishes a request. Waits for a certain amount of time for responses from interested services.

## Advantages of Asynchronous Messaging

* Reduced coupling - sender doesn't need to know about the consumer
* Multiple subscriber - multiple consumers can subscribe to receive events
* Failure isolation - if consumer fails, sender can still sends messages. messages will be picked up when the consumer recovers. Async messaging can handle intermittent downtime. Synchronous APIs require downstream service to be available, or the operation fails.
* Load levelling - You can have multiple messages queues. A message queue can act as a buffer to level the workload, so the receivers can process messages at their own rate.

## Disadvantages of Asynchronous Messaging

* Coupling with messaging infrastructure - using a messaging infrastructure can cause tight coupling with that infrastructure. might be harder to switch over to another messaging infrastructure later. 
* Latency - end-to-end latency for an operation could become high as message queues fill up
* Complexity - underlying infrastructure supportiung asynchronous messaging is complex. Ex - handling duplicated messages, correlating request & response messages using a separate queue.
* Throughput - In message queues, each message requires atleast (1 enqueue + 1 dequeue) operation. Also, queue semantics require some kind of locking inside the messaging infrastructure.


## Messaging Models

### Message Queues

* Asynchronous service-to-service communication
* Provides a lightweight buffer - temporarily store messages, and endpoints
* Messages are small - things like requests, info, replies, error messages, etc.
* Producer adds a message to queue (to send a message)
* Message is stored on the queue until a Consumer retrieves the message and does something with it
* Used in serverless and microservices architectures
* Messages are stored in the queue until they are processed (then they're deleted)
* Each message is processed only once, by a single consumer - one-to-one/point-to-point communications
* If a message needs to be processed by more than one consumer, message queues can be combined with Publisher/Subscriber messaging
* Can be used to decouple heavyweight processes
* Can be used to buffer, or batch work, and to handle spiky loads

### Publish Subscribe

#### Core Concepts

* Topic - An intermediary channel - maintains list of subsribers to whom messages received from publishers are to be relayed
* Message -  Serialized messages sent to a  Topic by a Publisher which has no knowledge of the Subscribers
* Publisher - App that publishes a Message to a Topic
* Subscriber - App that registers itself with a Topic inorder to receive the appropriate Messages

```
                                 _ Subscriber
                                /
Publisher -> Message -> Topic -> 
                                \_ Subscriber                             
```

#### Advantages

* Loose coupling - Publishers are never aware of the existence of subscribers, and vice versa. So, both systems can operate independently.

* Scalability - High level of scalability because of parallel operations, message caching, tree-based routing, support for multiple message queues, and other features of the pub-sub model.

#### Benefits

* Eliminate Polling - Message consumers don't need to periodically check/poll for new information and updates. Instead, Topics allow for instantaneous push-based delivey. Leads to faster response time, and reduces delivery latency.

* Dynamic Targeting - Publishers send messages to Topic. Topic forwards message to Subscribers. So, subscribers can "change, upgrade, multiple or disappear" and the system dynamically adjusts.

* Decouple and Scale independently

* Simplify communication - Reduces complexity by removing all the point-to-point connections between publishers and subscribers (as the topic manages the connection between Publisher and Subscriber)
