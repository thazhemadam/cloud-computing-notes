## REST and Web Services

## SoA

* REST and Web Services are a part of a more global principle/paradigm called Service Oriented Architecture. 
* SoA is a way of making software components reusable using standard interfaces that make use of a common communication interfaces/standards (like HTTP).
* Service interfaces - loosely coupled. 
* Code and data are integrated in such a way that you can execute a *complete and discrete business function*.

Two Major SoA - 
* REST - REpresentational State Transfer
* WS - Web Services

## REST

* Architectural style for providing standards for systems on the web, making it easier to communicate with each other in a *stateless* way - ensures that there's a *separation of concerns* b/w client and server.
* Developed in parallel with HTTP 1.1.

## REST Principles

* Resources are identified through name-location pairs - URIs (URL = URI + Protocol)
* There is a uniform, constrained interface (you can't operate with any kind of interface you want to)
* The message is self-descriptive - the metadata has enough information, that intermediaries acting on the message don't need to look into the contents of the message to process it.
* Stateless interactions

### Resource Identification through URIs

* Every resource can be identified by a URI, in a global addressing space (a URI for a resource is globally unique). (URI is the name of the object on the web).
* URI can be used to identify a resource by name, location, or both.

* URL is a subset of a URI.
* Difference between URI and URL - URL will specify the location of the resource, and how to retrieve the resource.

### Uniform Constrained Interfaces

Characteristics of REST operations -
* Safe - Operation doesn't modify resources.
* Idempotent - Making multiple identical requests has same effect as making a single request (system state isn't modified more than once).
 
            Safe    Idempotent
* GET       YES     YES
* PUT       NO      YES
* POST      NO      NO
* DELETE    NO      YES

### Self Descriptive

* REST message has enough information to describe how to process message.
* Intermediaries can do more with message without parsing its contents.
* Representation and Content are decoupled from each other - Same content, different formats - still valid (Ex - "`Accept`" field can have different values - like "text/html", "application/xml")
* Metadata about resource can be used for
  * Cache Control
  * Transmission Error detection
  * Authentication/Authorization
  * Access Control

### Stateless Interactions

* Each client request is treated independently
* How do you maintain states? Cookies.

#### Benefits

* Clients isolated against changes on server
* Promotes redundancy
  * don't need to know which server client was talking to
  * no synchronization overhead

### Some more REST Facts

* REST is NOT a standard
-> It's a design and architectural style for large scale distributed systems

* REST is NOT the same as HTTP
-> HTTP is a protocol. It can also be used in a non-RESTful way. Ex - SOAP services that use HTTP to transport data.

## Web Services

* Software system designed to support intreroperable, machine-to-machine interaction over a network.
* "self contained, self describing, modular" application designed to be used and accessible by other software applications over the web.
* other web services can discover and invoke a web service once it is deployed.

### SOAP

* SOAP has an envelope, and a body. It is often encapsulated in an XML packet.

* **Standard** packaging structure for transmitted XML documents over different internet protocols.
* Interoperability - because it is standard.
* Has a mandatory root element called "envelope" - encapsulate all the data in a SOAP message.
  * It contains - 
    * header element (header information)
    * body element (message payload)

### WSDL

* Web Services Description Language
* Describes the interface, a set of operations supported by a web service in **standard** format.
* Standardizes - representation of input + output parameters of its operations, service's protocol binding, how messages will be transferred onto wire.

### UDDI - Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration

* Global registry for advertising and discovery of web services

## Web Services in Action

How does a SOAP interaction occur?
// Probably need a better reference for this
* Web service provider develops a service using SOAP.
* Publish/Update service description - They then update the service description in the UDDI registry.
* Query to find a service - Made to UDDI registry by client to find service
* UDDI refers to the WSDL, and from the WSDL it can access the WSDL document.
* UDDI binds the WSDL document with the query, and returns it to the service requester.
* The service requester uses SOAP and then sends a request to the service Provider.
* The service provider responds to service requester.

## Web Services Protocol Stack 

* Transport Protocol - HTTP, SMTP, FTP, BEEP, etc.
* Messaging Protocol - responsible for encoding messages in a common XML format. XML-RPC, WS-Addressing, SOAP.
* Description Protocol - Used for describing public interface to a specific web interface. WSDL interface format.
* Discovery Protocol - Centralizes services in a common registry so that network Web services can publish location and description, and make it easy to discover what services are available on the network. UDDI is used.
