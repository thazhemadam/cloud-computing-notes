## Virtualization

* process of creating a software-based/virtual version of something - compute, networking, storage, servers or applications
* methodology of dividing resources of a computer into multiple execution environments
* present and partition resources logically (rather than physically)
* VM - isolated duplicate of the physical machine

### No Virtualization

### Why Virtualization?

* OS Diversity
* Security and Isolation (hypervisor separates VMs)
* Rapid Provisioning
* High availability/Load Balance (easy to migrate)
* Encapsulation

## VMM/Hypervisor

* Software that runs on a compute host, and virtualizes it
* Runs above the hardware on the physical server/host
* Layer between real hardware and traditional OS.
* Prevalent in hardware-level virtualization
* VMM manages the hardware resources
* Pulls resources from physical servers, and allocate them to virtual environments
* Acts as a traditional OS, as VMM captures process that try to acess the H/W

### 3 requirements for a VMM

1. Should provide an execution environment identical to that expected from the original machine
2. Should not affect execution times, and performance of programs
3. Should be in complete control of system resources

## Types of VMs

### Type1 - Bare Metal

* VMM runs on bare metal
* Directly controls the physical machine
* Less latency
* More secure
* Ex - HyperV, KVM, etc.

```

### Type2 - Hosted

* VMM runs on top of an OS
* Higher latency
* Ex - VirtualBox, VMWare Workstation, etc.
