## Paravirtualization

* Limits OS options
* Modified guest OS running on top of the VMM/Hypervisor
* Guest OS knows that it is running in a virtualized environment on top of hypervisor
* won't try to directly perform privileged operations (ring 0) it'll know will fail. Instead, it'll make explicit  `hypercalls` - calls to the hypervisor.

```

## Transparent/Full Virtualization

* OSes run without modifications on hypervisor
* OS thinks it's running on bare metal, but is actually is not
* Privileged instructions/instructions that require access to hardware, are relayed by the OS, and handled by the hypervisor which performs the hardware emulation (using trap and emulate), and returns the results.
* Sometimes, some instructions can silently fail. For these instructions, the hypervisor tracks these instructions and handles accordingly when these instructions fail.
* VMs are oblivious to the presence of other VMs using the same hardware

## Note

Need to make better notes on Paravirtualization vs Full Virtualization.\
Also, may be worth checking out the examples mentioned in the ppts.
