# Lecture 6

VMMs perform machine switches like OS performs context switching

## Goldberg/Popek Principles

### 3 Requirements for an architecture to efficiently support virtualization

* Equivalence/Fidelity - Program running on VM should behave essentially identical to a program executing directly on hardware
* Resource Control - VMM must be in total control of virtualized resources
* Efficiency - Great majority of machine instructions must be executed without intervention of the VMM (without traps)

### Virtual Machine - Definition and Desirable Qualities

An Efficient, Isolated, Duplicate of the physical machine

* Efficient - Low performance overhead - Performance is close to the real machine
* Isolated - Safety/Isolation - Each VM must be isolated from one another
* Duplicate - Equivalence - Interface must be same as the real machine's interface

### VMM

Software that creates and manages VMs

## Classification of Instructions

* Privileged Instructions\
Those that trap if processor is in user mode, and do not trap if it is in system/kernel mode.

* Sensitive instructions
  * Control Sensitive Instructions\
  Those that attempt to change the configuration of resources in the system, i.e., modify the system registers.

  * Behaviour Sensitive Instructions\
  Those whose behaviour/result depends on the mode/configuration of the hardware (content of relocation register or the mode of processor (user/kernel))
