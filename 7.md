## IaaS

* Physical Hardware + VM (treated as a physical hardware by user)

* Provision compute, storage, networks, and other fundamental so consumer can deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include OS and apps.

* Physical infrastructure is provided as a service to the users (who don't directly interact with the physical infrastructure)

* Compute - Providers manage the hypervisors and end users can then programatically provision virtual instances as they want. Also provides features for auto-scaling, and load balancing.

* Network - Networking in cloud is a type of "Software Defined Networking" - traditional networking hardware is made available programatically (typically through hardware). Cloud provider's responsibilty to ensure that it works as it would physically, and you can operate under the assumption that it's a physically connected system. They're logical abstractions made available to you.

* Storage - 3 types (block, file, object)

### Automatically configured and set up for you
* Virtualization
* Servers
* Storage
* Networking

### You Manage
* Applications
* Data
* Runtime
* Middleware
* OS

### Advantages

* Flexible
* Control - clients have more control over their infrastructure
* Pay as you go
* Speed - users can quickly provision resources
* Availability (things like multizone regions)
* Scale - seemingly limitless capacity and ability to scale (automated/supervised)
* Latency + Performance - broad geographical footprint/presence of IaaS providers. Easy to put services closer to users. 


### Limitations + Concerns

* Security - "Insider threats" - security threats can still be sourced from the host or other VMs, which may expose communication between host infrastructure and VMs
* Multi-tenant security (we can both use the same provider, but shouldn't be able to see/modify each others' data) - vendor has to ensure other customers can't access data stored by previous customer. 
* Internal resources + Training - you may need to learn how to actually handle and manage the infrastructure, so you can monitor and manage resources easily and efficiently.

## When to use IaaS

* Startups and small companies - less expensive (time + money)
* Large company - you know what you want and buy only what you need. you know how to control it. you have your applications and infrastructure properly set up, configured, and can control it
* Companies experience rapid growth - high degree of scalability
* Web hosting - can be less expensive than traditional web hosting
* Storage, backup and recovery - IaaS is useful for handling unpredictable demand and growing storage needs. Less work/headache for the company folks for setting up, backups and recovery. 
* HPC & Big data analysis - more economically sensible way for access to large amounts of processing power.
