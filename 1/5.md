## Distributed System Models

### What is a distributed computing environment?

Environment consisting of multiple autonomous computers - each having its own private memory - all communicating through a computer network by means message passing.

## Classification of Models

### Architectural
* How are responsibilities distributed among components and how are these components placed?
* Ex: Cluster Architecture, P2P, Client - Server

### Interaction
* How do we handle time? Are there limits on process execution, message delivery, and clock drifts?
* Ex: Synchronous, Asynchronous

### Fault
* What types of faults can occur? What are the effects of these faults?
* Ex: Omission faults, arbitrary faults, timing faults


## Architectural Models

## 1. Cluser Architecture

* Serveral autonomous nodes, connected to a network backbone
* Nodes are loosely coupled and pass messages between each other
* Cluster is connected to internet via a VPN gateway (point of access for users). The gateway IP address locates the cluster
* Loosely coupled
* System image of a computer is decided by the way the OS manages the shared cluster resources (I/O devices, disk arrays)
* Resources of a server node are managed by their own OS
* Most clusters have multiple system images as a result of having many nodes

## 2. P2P Architecture

* No central database
* No central coordination
* Nodes can be a client, or a server, or both
* No masters. No slaves.
* No machine has a global view of the entire P2P system
* System is self-organizing
* There is distributed control

## 3. Client-Server Model

* Set of processes (servers) offer services to users (clients)
* Centralized control
* Based on a request-reply protocol
* Whenever a client wants something, it makes an RPC call (like HTTP Request), to which the server then responds appropriately (result or the error code)
* This operates in an asynchronous manner

## 4. Some more

### 4.1. 3-Tier Model

* T1: Client - User Interface + Simple Business logic
* T2: Application Server - Contains the business logic
* T3: Database - stores data + some business logic can be applied in the form of stored procedures

### 4.2. n-tier

* 3-tier on wings
* Web apps that further forward requests to other enterprise services

### Note

Grid Architecture also comes under a architectural model

## Interaction Models

### 1. Synchronous Models

```
Process A           Process B
==============================
| |                      | 
 |----------------------| |
 |                      | |
 |                      | |
| |----------------------|
```

#### Features
* Lower and upper bounds on execution types of processes
* Messages transmitted must be received within a bound time (CN stuff)
* The difference in time between system clocks of the autonomous machines running Process A and Process B must have a known bound. Inorder to take care of this, Global Physical time is established (lamport clock, vector clock, matrix clock)

#### Consequences
* There is global physical time
* Predictable in terms of timing
* Can use timeouts to diagnose connectivity issues/network failures, failure of process/communication link, etc


### 2. Asynchronous Models

```
Process A           Process B
==============================
| |                       |
| |----------------------| |
| |                      | |
| |                      | |
| |-----------------------|
```

#### Features
* No bound on process execution type
* No bound on message transmission delays
* No bounds on drift rates between local clocks

#### Consequences
* No global physical time
* Unpredictable in terms of timing
* Can't use timeouts to diagnose issues

### Fault Models
* Can occur in proccess or communication channel
* Fault could be in software and hardware
* Fault models are needed to build systems with fault tolerance
* Fault tolerance - predictable behaviour in case of faults

#### Omission Errors
--------------------------------------------
| Class of failure | Affects | Description |
------------------------------------------
Fail stop | a process halts, and remains halted. other processes can detect this state.
crash | process | process halts and remains halted. other processes can't detect this state
Omission | Channel | Message inserted in the outgoing message buffer never arrives at other end's incoming message buffer
Send-omission | Process| Process sends, but message isn't put in its outgoing message buffer
Receive-omission | Process | message is put in process's incoming message buffer, but process doesn't receive it
Arbitrary/Byzantine | Process/Channel | Arbitrary behaviour - random messages are sent/recieved at arbitrary times (like noise)

#### Timing Failures
Clock | Process |- process's local clock exceeds bounds on its rate of drift from real time
Performance | Process |- Process exceeds bounds on the interval between two steps
Performance | Channel |- message transmission takes longer than the stated bound

* Applicable only to synchronous systems with set time limits
* Not applicable to asynchronous systems as no time limits can be guaranteed
