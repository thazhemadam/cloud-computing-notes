## What is Cloud Architecture?

Cloud Architecture - Various components engineered leverage the power of cloud resources to solve business problems

Defines the components as well as relationships between them

The components typically consist of - 

### Front End
Usually a browser - provides you an interface (UI), and exposes you to some of the business logic

### Backend
Usually consists of 2 business components - Application server (must handle application logic) and database server (must handle some application logic + stores data) 
The backend must take care of :
* security
* resource allocation/deallocation
* scaling
* backups
* fault tolerance
* billing

### Cloud Based Delivery
### Network

### Some components of Cloud Architecture

* Client Infrastructure - UI + Business Logic (way to interact with the cloud)
* Application - It can either be a platform (OS, DB, Application server) or software (CRM)
* Storage - Humongous amount of data is generated by the cloud architecture. Can be stored in three forms - Block Storage, File Storage, Object Storage.
* Services - IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, DaaS
* Management - manages the backend and overall infrastructure (coordination, replication, maintenance, etc)
* Security - Security management with virtual firewall (to prevent data loss, ensure data security)
* HyperVisor - How to implement virtualization
* Internet

### Design Goals of Cloud

* Scalability - Up, Down, Out, In
* Virtualization
* Efficiency - must use minimal resources while operating with a degree of performance guarantee
* Reliability - Must be reliable (and deterministic)

### Enabling Technologies for Cloud
* Fast platform deployment (HW + HyperVisor + Platform + App must be instantiated asap)
* Virtual clusters that must be available on demand
* Multitenant tech (otherwise, shared pool of resources will not happen, and the very essence of cloud computing is lost)
* Massive data processing (for offering and supporting personalized services)
* Distributed storage (for storing the data generated/being processed in an efficient and feasible way)
* Web scale communication
* Licensing and billing services (have to make *paisa*)

## Market-Oriented Cloud Architecture

* Very important to maintain a level of QoS
