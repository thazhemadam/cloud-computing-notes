## PaaS

* complete development + deployment environment in cloud
* provides a platform built on top of the abstracted hardware
* application level of things is controlled by user
* middleware is allocated by provider and managed by user
* HW, and mapping of HW to virtual resources (and everything else HW related) is controlled by provider
* Like IaaS includes infrastructure - servers, storage, and networking (like IaaS), **and** middleware also
* Middleware - OS, Compiler, IDE, DB servers, toolchains tools, etc.
* Designed to support complete web app lifecycle - build, test, deploy, manage, update

### Automatically configured and set up for you

* Virtualization
* Servers
* Storage
* Networking
* Runtime
* Middleware
* OS

### You Manage

* Applications
* Data

## Advantages

* Faster time to market - you don't need to purchase and install HW and software needed to build and maintain the dev platform
* Faster, easier, less-risky adoption of a wider range of resources - access to a lot of choices up and down the app dev stack. you can test new dev envs, and tools without having to invest the infrastructure needed. 
* Develop for multiple platforms - some providers give access to dev options for multiple platforms, enabling cross-platform app dev
* Cost-effective scalability - you can scale on-demand by purchasing just the amount of additonal capacity needed
* Geographically distributed development teams - development env can be accessed over the internet - enables global collaborative development
* Efficiently manage the application lifecycle - PaaS provides everything to support the complete web app lifecycle
* Lower costs - no infrastructure to build - upfront costs are lower.

## When to use PaaS

* Development Framework - when your development framework combination is being provided by a service provider
* Analytics or business intelligence - Tools provided with PaaS allow organizations to analyse and mine data - find insights, and patterns (like AWS Metrics) - AI stuff
* It can help streamline workflows when multiple developers are working on the same development program
* API development and management
* IoT - PaaS can support things needed for IoT deployments also

## Limitations and Concerns

* "Operational Limitations" - lack of control - related to degree of automation
* Vendor lock-in  (especially when vendor doesn't have convenient migration policies)
* Runtime issues - PaaS solution may not be optimized for the language, and frameworks of your choice. Customers may not be able to develop custom dependencies
* Data security - Orgs can run their apps + services using PaaS but data residing in 3rd party, vendor controlled cloud servers posses security risks and concerns. Limited security options - customers can't deploy services w/ specific hosting policies
* Integrations - integrating with existing services and infra might be a challenge.
* Customization of legacy systems - legacy systems may not be cloud compatible. so, you'll have to do several customizations/configurations (jugaad) to make it work with the PaaS service (integration problems). The resulting system might become very complex - may limit value of the PaaS investment altogether.
