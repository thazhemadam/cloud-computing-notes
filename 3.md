## 5 technologies that enable cloud computing

* Broadband networks & internet architecture
  * Internet stuff (similar to the internet infrastructure discussed in Computer Networks)
* Data Center tech
  * many different computers stacked one beside another. most computers in data centers are commodity computers.
* Virtualization tech
  * present in data centers
  * single piece of hardware can behave as if there are several different pieces of servers (virtual)
  * multiple virtual servers can sit on top of physical servers
  * each of these virtual servers behave as though they are independent, autonomous servers themselves
* Web tech
  * Standard HTTP, REST API, etc.
* Multitenant tech
  * Enables us to have multiple different clients, all using the same server, but isolated from one another.

## 3 Cloud Computing Models

* 1. IAAS
  * High flexibility - you can deploy whatever software you want on whatever hardware you want
  * Low Automation

  * Each physical server can be abstracted into multiple virtual servers.
  * Using HTTP requests, you can customize the hardware configuration you want.
  * IAAS is basically the model which allows you to customize the hardware configuration you want, and then avail it as a service using RPCs

* 2. PAAS
  * In addition to the hardware, an operating system and platform(s)/middleware(s) (like compiler toolchain, etc) is also made available to you; which is easily available to you via an RPC.

* 3. SAAS
  * High degree of automation - everything that you want is available to you
  * Low degree of flexibility

  * Very little scripting flexibility is available
  * You get your hardware, software, and business application
  * Business application is made readily available to you
