Cloud Computing: "Delivering computing at the Internet Scale".

Deliverables of Cloud Computing - Compute Storage, Networking Infrastructure
-> Whenever you want : on-demand
-> Wherever you want : ubiquitous - Broad Network Access (feature)
-> Very quickly : rapidly provisioned - Rapid Elasticity (feature)
-> Pay for only things you use - Measured Service (feature)(
-> All in a shared fashion : shared pool - Resource Pooling (feature)

Key Features
-> On demand self service - Agility (advantage)
-> Broad Network Access - Deploy globally in minutes (advantage)
-> Resource Pooling
-> Rapid Elasticity - Elasticity (advantage)
-> Measured Service - Cost Savings (advantage)

Advantages
-> Agility - get things as and when you want 
-> Elasticity
-> Cost Savings
> Deploy globally in minutes

Genesis
-> Mainframe - One computer to which everyone had to connect via a terminal.
-> Miniature forms of Mainframe - UNIX systems - terminals which connected systems to one single computer. these terminals would only send keystrokes and receive output to be displayed.
-> PC Architecture - Computing at home and on desktop. This led to the evolution into client server architecture.
-> Soon, Client=Server wasn't enough. so, multiple systems were combined. Same task was distributed among these computers, and the individual results was later combined. This led to distributed computing. This gave rise to cloud computing.

1. Web 1.0 : Very simple. Could search for webpages, and download them. Not at all interactive. Essentially was request of static webpages.
2. Web 2.0 : Client could send information to server. One of the primary reasons why cloud computing came into the picture.
3. IoT also made cloud computing very popular.

So may IP Address, so many devices sending info, since it is impossible for one system to handle all this processing, people started taking multiple systems together, clubbed their processing power, and offered that as a service.
Grid computing went out of existence, and then came cloud computing.

High Performance Computing.
-> Aggregating Computing power to deliver higher performance than a single computer can.

Distributed Computing
-> Multiple autonomous computers, each having their own memory & compute powers, that communicate wit each other by sharing information by passing messages on the network.
-> Several different OSes.

Parallel Computing
-> There are several processors (ONLY PROCESSORS ARE SEPARATE. THESE ARE NOT INDEPENDENT COMPUTERS) all of them communicating with one another by either message passing, or sharing a common central memory.
-> Single operating system.

Cloud Computing
-> Shared pool of resources (physical or virtual resources)
-> Can be centralized or distributed
-> Main technology driver for CC is parallel/distributed computing.

Cluster Computing
-> Several different machines - autonomous computers
-> Have a single image of an operating system 

Applications
-> Science adn ENgineering
-> Business, Education, Service Industry, Health Care
-> Internet and Web Services
-> Government Applications
-> Mission critical applications.

Design objectives of Cloud Computing
-> Efficiency: A particular task/process given to a CC resource must be done in the fastest and cheapest possible way
-> Dependability: CC resources are generally a conglomeration of various resources. Quality of service must not be compromised, even in the case one of these resources fails, and the service must be dependable no matter what.
-> Adaptation: Ability to support billions of requests over huge datasets under various workloads and service models.
-> Flexibility: We must be able to use it for both HPC (science and engineering) as well as HTC (business) applications 

Compute as a utility
-> Utility computing focuses on a business model in which customers receive computing resources from a paid service provider. All grid/cloud platforms are this only.
Attributes of CC converge with computing paradigms to provide CC as a service.

Evolution of WEB!
Web 1.0
-> 4 design essentials
	-> Static pages
	-> Content served from server's filesystem
	-> Pages built using Server Side Includes or MVC - Common Gateway Interface
	-> Frames and tables used to align elements on the pages
	-> Unidirectional communication only

Web 2.0
-> 2-way communicative medium
-> www that highlights user-generated content (information sent by client to the server generally), usability and interoperability for end users.
-> "participative social web"
-> Lot more info that was being passed to servers now from various clients
-> Major features
	-> Allows users to retreive and classify info collectively
	-> Dynamic user-input responsive content
	-> Info flow bw site owners and users (means of evaluation and online commenting)
	-> APIs

Web 3.0
-> AI in practice
-> Semantic Web: Web 2.0 performed matching using syntax/phrase based matching, without trying to understand the meaning of the words, thus no semantic information was processed. 
In Web 3.0, thanks to NLP, semantic meaning is also processed. This facilitates generation, sharing and connection of content through search and analysis based on the ability to understand.
-> 3D Graphics used in websites and services
-> Ubiquity: content accessible by multiples applications.

--> Web 3.0 is processing the information you give it to give you a personalized experience.
--> It is semantic content of the information you pass
